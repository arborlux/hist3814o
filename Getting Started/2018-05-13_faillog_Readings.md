## Fail Log

I'm currently using Visual Studio Code to record my fail logs since it can natively save to markdown format and push directly to GitHub. However, there isn't a spell checker, which is becoming rather annoying. I might need to switch to Microsoft Word to write my fail logs and stage, commit, and push to GitHub using the command line seperately. 

## Readings

Overall I found the [readings for this week](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/#some-readings-to-kick-things-off) to be rather complex. It took me several hours longer than I thought it would to get through it all. I enjoyed James Baker's two posts the most, and found Tim Hitchcook's blog post to be the most confusing thing I've read in quite awhile.
