### Website

I didn't have any initial issues on May 8th when I first setup the domain, installed WordPress, and configured an admin email for the website. But I ended up spending about an hour painstakingly trying to modify my original theme (Blogera) to allow custom social icons. In the end, I chose to switch to a different theme today (Startup Blog), which comes installed with just about every social media icon that exists. 

### Hypothesis

The unofficial [Hypothesis Aggregator][0] plugin by kshaffer doesn't seem to work natively with groups. According to the Hypothesis API it's possible to generate an API key and pass it as an argument when searching, which is what [jonudell.info][1] does. I've never worked with PHP before but the source code is simple enough to understand. Work has been insanely busy the past few weeks, but I'm hoping I find some spare time to take a further look and modify the code to work natively on my WordPress blog.

### Notes

I'm currently using Visual Studio Code to record my fail logs and notes since it can natively save to markdown format and push directly to GitHub. However, there isn't a spell checker, which is becoming rather annoying. I might need to switch to Microsoft Word to write my fail logs and stage, commit, and push to GitHub using the command line separately. 

### Readings

Overall I found the [readings for this week][2] to be rather complex. It took me several hours longer than I thought it would to get through it all. I enjoyed James Baker's [two][3] [posts][4] the most and found Tim Hitchcook's [blog post][5] to be the most confusing thing I've read in quite awhile.
