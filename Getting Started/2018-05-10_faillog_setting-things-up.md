## Website

I didn't have any initial issues on May 8th when I first setup the domain, installed WordPress, and configured an admin email for the website. But I ended up spending about an hour painstakingly trying to modify my orginal theme (Blogera) to allow custom social icons. In the end, I chose to switch to a different theme today (Startup Blog), which comes installed with just about every socialmedia icon that exists. 

### Hypothesis

The unofficial [Hypothesis Aggregator](https://github.com/kshaffer/hypothesis_aggregator) plugin by kshaffer doesn't seem to work natively with groups. According to the Hypothesis API it's possible to generate an API key and pass it as an argument when searching, which is what [jonudell.info](https://jonudell.info/h/facet/) does. I've never worked with PHP before but the source code is simple enough to understand. Work has been insanely busy the past few weeks, but I'm hoping I find some spare time to take a further look and modify the code to work natively on my WordPress blog.
