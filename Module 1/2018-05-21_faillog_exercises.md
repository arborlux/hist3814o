### Exercise 1

I initially had some issues finding an annotation that really stuck out to me, but luckily I found one that I really wanted to respond to. Read it [here][1].

### Exercise 2

I'm fairly accustomed to using VPNs and Linux, no issues for this exercise!

### Exercise 3

Turns out I already had most of this exercise completed last week.

### Exercise 4

This was a nice refresher to have. I don't often use the command line directly for git, instead I normally use the git and Microsoft Team Services extensions for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. It's the same commands and syntax of course, but the enxtensions include a number of shortcuts so I don't normally have to type everything out.

For Exercise 4.7 I created a pull request on [Danny Jooste's][2] hist3814o repository. 

Since I didn't have any pull requests on my repository, I did this module's work in it's own branch and merged it into master branch.
