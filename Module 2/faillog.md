So like the previous week, I failed by leaving this to the absolute last minute.

No issues following any of the exercise instructions thankfully and the readings were relatively light. 

I also had issues keeping up with Zulip this week, so I didn't respond to anyone. 

## Exercise 6: Using Tesseract to turn an image into text
