## Exercise 2: [Typography][1]

### Results
1. My [GitHub Page][2] for this exercise.

### Notes 
* This exercise focuses on making [smart font choices][3] while digital content and using [GitHub Pages][4] for displaying that content. 
    * You can publish a folder or repository to a GitHub Page using a [gh-pages][5] branch!
* [Google Fonts][6] is an excellent resource for trying and using freely available fonts and it also includes the correct syntax to include those fonts in your project.

## Exercise 3: [Colour][7]

### Notes 
* [Very interesting guide][8] to choosing colours and the chemical, mental, and emotional responses they have for people. 

## Exercise 4: [Creating an online exhibit with Omeka][9]

### Results
1. See my Omeka created collection [here][10].
    1. Collection is based off the [Gatineau Valley Historical Society fire insurance maps][11].

### Notes 
* [Omeka][12] seems like a very lightweight, almost headless, [CMS][13] focused on hosting collections. It provides a lot of sourcing and metadata fields by default for each item you add to a collection. It also has a plugin available to make it compatible with [Zotero][14]!
* I didn't realize that Reclaim Hosting had a built in editor under file manager for editing css, html, php, etc. files. Very cool!
