This is in response to the following [annotation](https://hypothes.is/a/00-vsFiFEeijmh-3Z-5QAg) by [Sherlyn Assam](https://github.com/sherlynassam). I found it so interesting because it made me revaluate my position on Ian Milligan's [blog post](https://ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/) about SSHRC's data accessibility policy. 

Originally, I hadn't given much value to the opinion of researchers that would not want to share their research and notes. I made an [annotation](https://hypothes.is/a/yTr1BFyJEeif4UMQj89P1g) explaining my position on the matter. But as Sherlyn puts it, I wouldn't want to share my homework with someone else who didn't bother to put in the effort themselves. It seems petty, but credit is a very important part of being rewarded for an accomplishment that took a lot of effort to achieve. I'm sure the majority of researchers work incredibly hard to win funding competitions to earn their awards to fund their research. The key being *their*. 

Personally, I think open source software is an incredible thing. It's surprising, but if you put your work out there for others to see and find, then typically you will find people who are willing to contribute and help make it better.

However, I haven't changed my opinion on the matter. I still think that research publicly funded should be held accountable to the public, just like Government budgets and spending is mostly [held publicly accountable][1]. 

Ian Milligan talks about this in his blog post. But SSHRC publicly releases the names and dollar amounts of all award winners on [Canada's Open Government website][2]. I wonder how much could potentially be saved if all of the research done using this money ([SSHRC's grants and scholarships budget][3] for 2016-17 is $380.2 million!) was open to all researchers. How many researchers do not receive enough funding to complete their research, when it has already been done before and could have/should have been published publicly?
