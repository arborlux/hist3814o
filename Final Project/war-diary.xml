            <summary>This was especially so in the case of North american Indian troops, and of the few deaths occurring in Hospital the majority were Indians. Ailments mainly bronchial and pulmonary. Measles, Mumps and other infectious diseases very prevalent and the capacity of the Hospital was greatly overtaxed to accommodate the patients. Owing to total lack of Surgical, Laboratory and X-ray facilities the majority of surgical and special cases were transferred to other hospitals for treatment, notably 2nd Eastern General Hospital, BRIGHTON. Three ambulances were in use at this time.</summary>
