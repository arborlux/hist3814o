# Crafting Digital History

This public repository is my notebook for [Crafting Digital History](http://site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/) (HIST3814o), a history course offered at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/). It will also contain my fail logs as I encounter issues crafting digital history. 

## Modules

Logs for each module of the course will be self contained in their own folder (Getting Started, Module 1, Module 2, etc.). 

0. [Getting Started](/Getting%20Started/)
1. [Module 1](/Module%201/)
2. [Module 2](/Module%202/)
