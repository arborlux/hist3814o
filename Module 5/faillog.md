I failed this week by not completing exercises 1,3. I started both of them, but neither of them resonated with me and I felt like I wasn't getting what I was supposed to out of them.

Work on the final project has also been rather slow this week. I wanted to be completely done by today but I still have more to complete unfortunately.
